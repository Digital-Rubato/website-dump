# website-dump

These were all pieces and tests that i did in the lead up to my website. Some were just ideas. Others were tests after reading a book about grid layout. Others still were tutorials that i stopped because of other issues. A lot of the snippets will repeat with minor change because i wanted to experiment with certain implementation or try and break it down to make sure it worked better than i saw it.
